    "## Introduction\n",
    "This end-to-end data science project started as a final assignment for a Data Science course at Milwaukee School of Engineering. In this project, we will explore real-world data which contains information about video games published on Steam - Digital distribution platform developed by Valve Corporation. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will go through the basic process of data science and explore this particular data in the following sections.\n",

    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "First of all, we need to get our hypotheses ready. Here are some questions we will try to answer and problems we will try to solve:\n",
    "* **Do Free-To-Play games have more DLCs?**\n",
    "    * Free games, in order to make a profit, could have more paid DLCs than games that are not free-to-play. Of course, there are other methods (e.g. Microtransactions) which could be more preferable among free-to-play games.\n",
    "    * After a brief search on Steam, we can see that paid DLCs are pretty common among the bigger free-to-play games (extensions packs, collector packs...).\n",
    "    * **Hypothesis 1:** Free-to-Play games have on average more DLCs than paid games.\n",
    "* **Examine increase in games that support VR according to time**\n",
    "    * We could see a rise in popularity of VR games in recent years. How many games with VR support have been released? Can we see a significant increase in this type of games?\n",
    "    * **Hypothesis 2:** Each year the number of games with VR support being released increases.\n",
    "* **What features contribute to number of owners and can we predict it?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides these questions, we will also try to take as many observations as we can to understand this data better."

    "We can clearly see, that the number of games being released on Steam is rising exponentially. As the dataset was created at the end of 2016, the drop at the end of this histogram is because these games were only announced to be released at that time. Let's plot a similar histogram, that will show us exactly how many games were released each year. We can also ask questions as: Are some month more preferred for releasing games than others? Are games being released at the end of the week or rather at the beginning? "
